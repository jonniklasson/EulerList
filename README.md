# EulerList
Solving problems on the Euler list* using Python.

I suggest not using this as a guide to the problems since the point of the Euler list is to learn by solving the problems yourself.

I am not a mathematician so there is alot of things for me to learn.

The main goal of this project is to learn the language.

A good example of this is problem 9 about pythagorean triplets. Since there is an easy to implement (but maybe hard to understand) way to generate triplet from 3 linear equations** starting with the first one (3,4,5) the problem is a great way to get into tree data structures. Since every iteration would produce 3 "child" pythagorean triplets.
